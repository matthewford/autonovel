A "hard fact" is anything a writer must not contradict: names, ages, dates, physical descriptions,
rules of the magic system, geography, relationships, established events.

SOURCE DOCUMENTS:

=== SEED.TXT ===
{seed}

=== WORLD.MD ===
{world}

=== CHARACTERS.MD ===
{characters}

FORMAT THE OUTPUT AS CANON.MD with these categories:

## Geography
- Specific facts about locations, distances, physical properties

## Timeline
- Dated events, ages, durations

## Magic System Rules
- Hard rules of the speculative system, costs, limitations
- The protagonist's unusual abilities or constraints, if any

## Character Facts
- Ages, physical descriptions, habits, relationships
- One entry per fact (not paragraphs)

## Political / Factional
- Who controls what, alliances, conflicts, contracts

## Cultural
- Customs, taboos, laws, festivals, food, clothing

## Established In-Story
- Events that have already happened in the story's past
- The Perin contract, the Expansion Wars, etc.

RULES:
- One fact per bullet point. Short. Specific. Checkable.
- Include the source (world.md or characters.md) in parentheses after each fact.
- Aim for 80-120 entries minimum. Be exhaustive.
- If two documents give slightly different details, note the discrepancy.
- DO NOT invent facts. Only record what's explicitly stated.
